### Businees Context

Data science-focused Ed Tech organisations typically receive a large number of applications for their training programmes before hiring people on a permanent basis. The employers want to discover which of those trainees are genuinely interested in working for them or if they plan to hunt for another job after training. In addition to lowering training costs, this will increase employee retention and satisfaction. Using the candidate's existing credentials, demographics, experience data, etc., this work aims to interpret the key elements influencing the candidate's decision and then develop a prediction model to estimate the likelihood that the candidate would either hunt for a new job or stay on staff. 

### Objective
The goal of the Ed Tech company is to forecast the probability that candidates will depart the organisation during training or not. As the company's data scientist, you will be responsible for analysing the primary factors influencing candidates' decisions and developing a prediction model that will forecast the likelihood that a candidate will either leave the company or look for another one based on information such as experience, demographics, and current credentials.

#### What is City Development Index?

* The City Development Index gauges the degree of urban development and was created for the 1996 Habitat II Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements. The indicator was created by the UN-Habitat Urban Indicators Programme to allow for the ranking of cities globally based on their degree of development and to serve as a presentation of indicators that illustrate development. The CDI, which is based on five sub-indices—infrastructure, waste, health, education, and city product—cuts across the several clusters noted in the Urban Indicator Framework. It is helpful since it gives a quick overview of how cities are performing in relation to the various indices.
