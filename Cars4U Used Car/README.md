### Business Context

Used automobiles are in high demand in the Indian market right now. The pre-owned car market has grown over the past few years and is currently bigger than the new car market, notwithstanding the recent slowdown in new car sales. A young software start-up called Cars4U wants to get into this market by finding openings.

While 3.6 million new automobiles were sold in 2018, there were about 4 million used cars purchased and sold. Sales of new cars are slowing down, which may indicate that consumers' preferences are changing to the pre-owned market. In fact, rather than purchasing brand-new vehicles, several auto dealers opt to swap out their outdated vehicles for pre-owned ones. Used cars are very different animals with enormous uncertainty in both pricing and supply compared to new cars, where price and supply are fairly deterministic and managed by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer), with the exception of dealership level discounts that only apply in the final stages of the customer journey. In light of this, these used automobiles' price strategy becomes crucial to their ability to expand in the market.

As a senior data scientist at Cars4U, you have to come up with a pricing model that can properly estimate the price of used automobiles and may help the business in creating profitable strategies employing differential pricing. For instance, if the company is aware of the going rate, it will never sell anything for less.
