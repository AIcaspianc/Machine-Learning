**Problem Statement - HR Attrition**

**Case Study: HR Attrition using Ensemble Techniques**

**Context:**

â€¢ McCurr Consultancy is a multinational corporation with thousands of workers located all over the world. The business is committed to employing the greatest talent and keeping them on board for as long as feasible. Through a variety of programmes, a significant amount of resources is used to keep current personnel. Retention costs should be reduced, according to the head of people operations. He suggests restricting the incentives to those who are most likely to be let go in order to address this. You have been tasked with finding trends in the traits of departing employees as a newly appointed Data Scientist in the People Operations Department. Additionally, you must utilise this data to determine whether an employee is likely to attrition. We'll use this data to specifically target them with incentives.

**Problem:**

**The data-set aims to answer the following key questions:**

- What are the different factors that can help in identifying attriting employees?
- Can we build a model to predict the attrition of employees? What should be the metric of choice to evaluate such a model?
