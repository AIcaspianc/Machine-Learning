**Introduction**
 
Welcome to our GitHub repository where we delve into the fascinating world of machine learning through a practical case study on credit risk assessment. In this repository, you will find a comprehensive analysis using a dataset that provides insights into various factors influencing the creditworthiness of individuals. Our primary focus is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of loan default based on multiple independent variables such as checking account balance, credit history, loan purpose, and loan amount, among others.

The core of this repository is a Jupyter Notebook titled "Ensemble Hands-On Bagging , I employ ensemble learning techniques, specifically Bagging, to enhance the predictive power of our models. The notebook guides you through each step of the process, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model building and evaluation. Our approach emphasizes practical implementation, making it an excellent resource for learners and practitioners alike who are interested in applying machine learning techniques in the financial domain.
