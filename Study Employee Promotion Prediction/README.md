### Business context

The ascent of an employee to higher levels is known as employee promotion, and it is this component of the job that most motivates employees. The ultimate reward for commitment to and devotion to a company is promotion, and the HR department is crucial in managing all of these jobs based on ratings and other accessible factors.

The HR department at JMD Company kept records of the previous year's promotion cycle, including information about every employee who worked there the previous year and whether or not they received a promotion. However, this process is always delayed because there are so many details available for each employee, making it challenging to compare and make decisions.


### Objective

The HR team intends to use machine learning and the stored data to create a model that will determine a person's eligibility for promotion or not in time for the next assessment cycle. As the JMD company's data scientist, it is your job to develop the best model you can to assist the HR department in determining whether an applicant is qualified for advancement or not.
