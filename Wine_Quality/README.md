**Case Study on Wine Quality Prediction: Wine Quality Forecast**

Wine is a low-alcohol beverage prepared from fermented grape juice and other fruit juices. One of the most widely used alcoholic beverages worldwide, wine is the second most popular after beer.

Usually, vintage and wine flavour are used to determine wine quality, but this method is inefficient, expensive, and takes a long time because other physiochemical characteristics, such as volatile and fixed acidity, also affect wine quality. Furthermore, since it would greatly raise the price, it is not always feasible for specialists to guarantee wine quality when there is a high demand for the commodity.

A red wine manufacturer called Moonshine offers premium, high-grade wines. The company's goals are to increase production efficiency while lowering wine tasting expenses and time commitment.

Using the data at hand, you, as the data scientist for Moonshine Company, must develop a prediction model that will assist in identifying the wines of the highest calibre.

**Goal:**

The following important questions are addressed by the data set: 

What are some distinguishing characteristics of a premium, high-quality wine?

Is it possible to create a model to distinguish premium wines? What is the best metric to use when assessing this kind of model?

**Attribute Information:**

- fixed acidity: Fixed Acidity impart sourness and resist microbial infection, measured in no. of grams of tartaric acid per dm3
- volatile acidity: No. of grams of acetic acid per dm3 of wine. Too high levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar-like taste
- citric acid: No. of grams of citric acid per dm3 of wine. Citric acid can add freshness and flavor to wines
- residual sugar: Remaining sugar after fermentation stops, measured in no. of grams per dm3.
- chlorides: No. of grams of sodium chloride i.e. salt per dm3 of wine
- free sulfur dioxide: No. of grams of free sulfite per dm3 of wine
- total sulfur dioxide: No. of grams of total sulfite (free sulphite+ bound) per dm3 of wine
- density: Density in gram per cm3
- pH: Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). The pH of the wine can help measure the ripeness of the wine
- sulphates: No. of grams of potassium sulfate per dm3 of wine
- alcohol: Volume of alcohol in percentage
- quality: Wine quality score between 3 to 8
