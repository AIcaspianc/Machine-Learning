**Problem Statement - German Credit Analysis**

**Case Study: German Credit Analysis**

**Context:**

When a bank gets a loan application, it must determine whether to approve the loan based on the applicant's profile. The bank's choice is accompanied with two kinds of risks:

1. If the borrower is a good credit risk—that is, someone who is likely to repay the loan—the bank will lose revenue if the loan is denied.
2. The bank suffers a financial loss when it approves a loan for someone who is a bad credit risk, meaning they are unlikely to repay the loan.

In order to reduce this loss, HRE Bank intends to automate this procedure by utilising a predictive model that will determine, depending on the customer's socioeconomic and demographic profiles, whether the consumer is likely to default or not.

As an HRE Bank data scientist, you have been tasked with creating a predictive model that will determine whether or not a customer is at risk of default.

**Problem:**

**The data-set aims to answer the following key questions:**

- What are the key features leading a person to default?
- To predict if a customer is going to default or not?

**Attribute Information:**

- The data contains the following characteristics of the people

    - Age (Numeric: Age in years)
    - Sex (Categories: male, female)
    - Job (Categories : 0 - unskilled and non-resident, 1 - unskilled and resident, 2 - skilled, 3 - highly skilled)
    - Housing (Categories: own, rent, or free)
    - Saving accounts (Categories: little, moderate, quite rich, rich)
    - Checking account (Categories: little, moderate, rich)
    - Credit amount (Numeric: Amount of credit in DM - Deutsche Mark)
    - Duration (Numeric: Duration for which the credit is given in months)
    - Purpose (Categories: car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation/others)
    - Risk (0 - Person is not at risk, 1 - Person is at risk(defaulter))
