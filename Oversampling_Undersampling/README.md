Loan default causes banks to suffer large losses. As a result, loan underwriting has become more stringent, and the number of loans that are rejected has gone up. Banks also highlight the need for an improved credit risk rating approach. 

The CNK bank has collected customer data for the previous few years and wants to construct a model to predict if a customer coming to purchase a loan is a good customer (will not default) or a bad customer (will default).
