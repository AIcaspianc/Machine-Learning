**Problem Description for Diabetes Risk Prediction Case Study** :

**Background of Diabetes Risk Prediction**

One of the most common diseases in the world, diabetes is becoming more and more common among sufferers. Although the exact aetiology of diabetes is still unknown, researchers think that environmental lifestyle factors and genetics both contribute significantly to the disease.

Diabetes increases the chance of acquiring certain secondary health problems, including heart disease and nerve damage. Therefore, diabetes can be detected and treated early to avoid complications and lower the chance of developing serious health issues. Despite being incurable, medicines and treatment can help manage it.

In order to better understand this disease in women, researchers at the Bio-Solutions lab seek to detect people who are at risk of diabetes by using machine learning models.

Building a classification model utilising a dataset gathered by the "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" that includes multiple attributes that help determine a person's risk of diabetes is your task as a data scientist at Bio-Solutions.

Goal: The data set seeks to provide answers to the following important queries: 

What are the several factors that can be used to determine if a person is at risk of developing diabetes?

Is it possible to create a model to determine who is most likely to get diabetes? What is the best metric to use when assessing this kind of model?
